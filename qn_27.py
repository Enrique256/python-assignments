"""
27. We have a variable named x which is assigned an integer, and a variable y which is assigned with a floating point number. We find the sum of these two numbers, and store the result in variable z. Then we print the data type of variable z using type() built-in function. What would be the type of z? x = 5 y = 3.14 z = x + y print(type(z)) #Output: …………………….

"""
x=5
y=3.14
z=x+y
print(type(z))
#output:<class 'float'>
